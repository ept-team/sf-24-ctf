# Christmas
Author: Vealending
## Description
```
When I was a child I always thought that countries without snow just didn't celebrate christmas at all. Turns out I was a stupid child.
Can you be a smart adult and figure out which building housed this awesome christmas decor?

`PS`: Remember to wrap the flag in the format `SF24{name_of_building}` (all lower case)
