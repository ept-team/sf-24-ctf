# Out on Tour

## Description
```
I really enjoyed the hike to a nice cozy lake from this location, but I can't remember where I started from. 
I know I took this photo from the end of a road somewhere in South-Western Norway, but what is that road called??

`PS`: The flag is the name of the road wrapped in SF24{}, e.g., SF24{Svartedalsveien}
