# Riverside
Author: tbi
## Description
```
I love rivers and I love airports. What's the name of the rivers that meet close to this airport?

`PS`: Remember to wrap the flag in the format `SF24{}`

`PPS`: Instead of spaces, use underscores, e.g. `SF24{<name of the river>_and_<name of the river>}` (all lower case and without <>)
