## Description
```
My friend MARKOV was one of those open source fanatics, his love for freedom ironically CHAINing him to his desk, never touching grass.
He was a great man, but went kinda loco in his later years. After his death I received a copy of his manifest and some weird ramblings.
Can you see if there is something more to it than meets the eye?
