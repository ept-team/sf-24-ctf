# Dotfuscate
Author: tbi
## Description
```
Seems like everyone knows linux binary reversing. That's why I 
wrote my new flag decoder in Microsoft dotnet and compiled it 
as an exe file! I bet it's a lot harder to reverse. Now, how the heck 
does print work in C# again? Oh well, I'll fix that part later.
